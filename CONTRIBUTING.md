# How to Contribute to a Repository on GitHub



## 1. Fork the repository
Before you can make any changes to the code, you need to create a fork of the [amplabs-ai/amplabs](https://github.com/amplabs-ai/amplabs) repository. Forking creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. You can then make changes to this copy and submit a pull request to the original repository.

## 2. Clone the repository
Once you have forked the repository, you need to clone it to your local machine. You can do this using the `git clone` command in the terminal or through a Git client like GitHub Desktop.

## 3. Create a new branch
Before making any changes, itâ€™s best to create a new branch in your local repository. This makes it easier to track the changes you make and keeps your master branch clean. You can create a new branch using the `git checkout -b` command.

## 4. Make changes
Now you can start making changes to the code. Be sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.

## 5. Commit changes
After making your changes, you need to commit them to your local repository. You can do this using the `git commit` command. Be sure to write a descriptive commit message that explains the changes you made.

## 6. Push changes
Finally, you need to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub. You can do this using the `git push` command.

## 7. Submit a pull request
Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the original repository. A pull request allows the repository maintainers to review your changes and merge them into the original code if they are approved.

## 8. Respond to feedback
The repository maintainers may provide feedback on your changes. Be sure to respond to any comments or questions they have and make any necessary changes to your code.

By following these steps, you can make a valuable contribution to our repository on GitHub and become a part of the Amplabs open-source community.
