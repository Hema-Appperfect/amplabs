# About Us

Tools for scientists, researchers, and engineers to analyze, publish, and collaborate in order to modernize our energy systems.

# AmpLabs Platform

AmpLabs is a community managed and maintained Battery Data Platform that helps you organize, harmonize, plot, and publish your data. 

Built off of the [Battery Lifecycle Framework](https://github.com/battery-lcf) with integrations into other community projects such as [BEEP](https://github.com/TRI-AMDD/beep) and [Galvanalyser](https://github.com/Battery-Intelligence-Lab/galvanalyser). AmpLabs puts these components together in a scalable and performant way to bring the concepts introduced by the [Battery Data Genome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07278) in a user friendly manner.

# How to Use

AmpLabs is a cloud platform. The platform can be accessed by visiting https://amplabs.ai or via AmpLabs API. Information about how AmpLabs API works can be found on [AmpLabs API Docs](http://amplabs.ai/api/). Each of the following examples show how to interact with AmpLabs API to do useful work.

## Examples

This repo is the home for AmpLabs examples.

### Python Examples

The below examples are hosted in Google Colab, an environment that helps users run Jupyter notebooks with no setup required. These examples are implemented in python but the concepts can be applied to any language.
