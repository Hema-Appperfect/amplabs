# About Us

AmpLabs helps teams build better batteries. 

Building off of the great Open Source work related to the Battery Data Genome, we are developing the components to realize an Open Source Battery Data Platform to help the entire battery value chain cut down on redundant work. 

We want to close the gaps on solved problems so that teams can focus on building better batteries.

# AmpLabs Platform

AmpLabs is a community managed and maintained Battery Data Platform that helps you organize, harmonize, plot, and publish your data. 

Built off of the [Battery Lifecycle Framework](https://github.com/battery-lcf) with integrations into other community projects such as [BEEP](https://github.com/TRI-AMDD/beep) and [Galvanalyser](https://github.com/Battery-Intelligence-Lab/galvanalyser). AmpLabs puts these components together in a scalable and performant way to bring the concepts introduced by the [Battery Data Genome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07278) in a user friendly manner. 

Try out the live hosted version of AmpLabs by visiting https://amplabs.ai

If you are interested in deploying AmpLabs in your battery lab please email us at ask@amplabs.ai

# How to Use

AmpLabs is a cloud platform. The platform can be accessed by visiting https://amplabs.ai or via AmpLabs API. Information about how AmpLabs API works can be found on [AmpLabs API Docs](http://amplabs.ai/api/). Each of the following examples show how to interact with AmpLabs API to do useful work.

This repository contains worked examples of how to integrate into AmpLabs Cloud from various systems using the AmpLabs API. If there are systems you'd like AmpLabs to integrate into please start by filing a GitHub Issue


## Examples

### Python Examples

The below examples are hosted in Google Colab, an environment that helps users run Jupyter notebooks with no setup required. These examples are implemented in python but the concepts can be applied to any language.
